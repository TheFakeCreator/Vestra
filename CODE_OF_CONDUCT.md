# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Version 2.1 — September 9, 2014

Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at `conduct@vestra.example.com`(replace with a real address later).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may
be posted separately.

Enforcement Guidelines

1.  Consequences of unacceptable behavior may range from a warning to
    expulsion from the community (a temporary or permanent ban) without
    further notice.
2.  If the reporter or the person being reported is a trusted contributor of
    the project, the maintainers may temporarily remove that person's
    privileges while the report is investigated.
3.  Further details of enforcement (for example, timelines or appeals
    processes) may be documented separately and linked from this code of
    conduct.
